Not released.

## DLA-Future 0.7.1

### Bug fixes

- Fixed missing includes of `<complex>`. (#1243)

## DLA-Future 0.7.0

### Changes

- Added (generalized) eigensolver which computes only a part of the eigenspectrum. (#1194)
- `Norm` is now fully asynchronous. (#1221)

### Performance improvements

- Refactored communication to use pika's `transform_mpi` and polling support. (#1125)
- Use custom coalescing heuristic for memory pools. (#1183)
- Added configuration option for number of CUDA streams and cuBLAS/SOLVER handles. (#1222, #1182)
- Some algorithmic clean-ups and improvements. (#1213, #1219, #1232)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed builds with CUDA and stdexec enabled. (#1188)
- Work around buggy HIP complex operator overloads. (#1195)
- Namespace (SCA)LAPACK CMake modules with DLAF to avoid conflicts with other packages. (#1178)

## DLA-Future 0.6.0

### Changes

- Renamed ScaLAPACK-like generalized eigensolvers `pXsygvx`/`pXhegvx` to `pXsygvd`/`pXhegvd`. (#1168)
- Introduced generalized eigensolver where the matrix B is already factorized. (#1167)

### Performance improvements

- Local eigenvector permutations in the distributed tridiagonal eigensolver are executed directly in GPU memory. (#1118)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed ScaLAPACK detection in CMake for specific uenv cases. (#1159)

## DLA-Future 0.5.0

### Changes

- Introduced an option (*) for forcing contiguous GPU communication buffers. (#1096)
- Introduced an option (*) for enabling GPU aware MPI communication. (#1102)
- Removed special handling of Intel MKL, as it could lead to broken installations. (#1149)
    - Spack installations: spack will set the correct variables.
    - Manual installations: the user is responsible to correctly set variables (see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)).

(*) These options are available as spack variants.

### Performance improvements

- Don't communicate in algorithms when using single rank communicators. (#1097)
- Fixed slow performance of local version of `bt_band_to_tridiagonal` (#1144)

### Bug fixes

- Implemented a workaround for `hipMemcpyDefault` 2D memcpys, due to bugs in HIP. (#1106)
- Miniapps initialize HIP before MPI, as on older Cray MPICH versions initializing HIP after MPI leads to HIP not seeing any devices. (#1090)

## DLA-Future 0.4.1

### Bug fixes

- Update project version and export it in CMake. (#1121)

## DLA-Future 0.4.0

### Changes

- Modified `CommunicatorGrid` to avoid blocking calls to `MPI_Comm_dup`. It now returns communicator pipelines. (#993)
- Added support for Intel oneMKL and the `intel-oneapi-mkl` spack package. (#1073) (*)

### Performance improvements

- Reduced the size of the matrix-matrix multiplications in the tridiagonal eigensolver to cover only the non deflated part of the eigenvectors. (#951, #967, #996, #997, #998)
- Introduced stackless threads where appropriate. (#1037)

### Bug fixes

- Use `drop_operation_state` to avoid stack overflows. (#1004)

### Notes

(*) At the time of the release the spack spec `blaspp~openmp ^intel-oneapi-mkl threads=openmp` doesn't build. If you rely on multithreaded BLAS we suggest to use `blaspp+openmp ^intel-oneapi-mkl threads=openmp` until https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/42087 gets merged.
