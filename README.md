# Distributed Linear Algebra from the Future

DLA-Future is a distributed linear algebra library implemented using C++ `std::execution` [P2300](https://cplusplus.github.io/sender-receiver/execution.html) which provides:
- an asynchronous C++ interface,
- a synchronous C interface,
- a synchronous ScaLAPACK-like C interface (ScaLAPACK drop-in with a subset of ScaLAPACK arguments. E.g. workspace arguments are not present),
- a synchronous ScaLAPACK-like Fortran interface (See [DLA-Future-Fortran](https://github.com/eth-cscs/DLA-Future-Fortran)).

DLA-Future runs on x86 and ARM CPUs as well as NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.

Currently DLA-Future provides the following algorithms which are available in the following interfaces:
| ScaLAPACK Name | Algorithm | C++ API | C API | Scalapack C API |
|----------------|-----------|:-------:|:-----:|:---------------:|
| `P[S,D,C,Z]TRMM` | Triangular Matrix Multiplication | ✔️ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `P[C,Z]HEMM`, `P[S,D]SYMM` | Hermitian Matrix Multiplication | ✔️ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `P[S,D,C,Z]TRSM` | Triangular Solver | ✔️ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `P[S,D,C,Z]POTRF` | Cholesky Decomposition | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| `P[C,Z]HEEV*`, `P[S,D]SYEV*` | Symmetric / Hermitian eigenvalue solver | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| `P[C,Z]HEGV*`, `P[S,D]SYGV*` | Generalized Symmetric / Hermitian eigenvalue solver | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |

Notes:
- The C++ interface provides a non distributed interface as well.

## Getting started with DLAF

### Build

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

### Link your program/library with DLAF

Using DLAF in a CMake project is extremely easy!

In the following, the variable `DLAF_INSTALL_PREFIX` is set to where DLAF is installed. In case you used spack for installing DLAF, you can easily set it with:

```bash
export DLAF_INSTALL_PREFIX=`spack location -i dla-future`
```

Then, you can configure your project with one of the following:

```bash
# By appending the value to the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${DLAF_INSTALL_PREFIX} ..

# ... or by setting DLAF_DIR
cmake -DDLAF_DIR="$DLAF_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/cmake" ..
```

Then, it is just as simple as adding these directives in your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```
find_package(DLAF)
# ... and then for your executable/library target
target_link_libraries(<your_target> PRIVATE DLAF::DLAF)
```

### Documentation

- [Documentation of `master` branch](https://eth-cscs.github.io/DLA-Future/master/)
- [Documentation of `v0.9.0`](https://eth-cscs.github.io/DLA-Future/v0.9.0/)

See [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) for the documentation of older versions, or for the instructions to build it.
