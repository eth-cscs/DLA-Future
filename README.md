# Distributed Linear Algebra from the Future

## Getting started with DLAF

### Build

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

### Link your program/library with DLAF

Using DLAF in a CMake project is extremely easy!

In the following, the variable `DLAF_INSTALL_PREFIX` is set to where DLAF is installed. In case you used spack for installing DLAF, you can easily set it with:

```bash
export DLAF_INSTALL_PREFIX=`spack location -i dla-future`
```

Then, you can configure your project with one of the following:

```bash
# By appending the value to the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${DLAF_INSTALL_PREFIX} ..

# ... or by setting DLAF_DIR
cmake -DDLAF_DIR="$DLAF_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/cmake" ..
```

Then, it is just as simple as adding these directives in your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```
find_package(DLAF)
# ... and then for your executable/library target
target_link_libraries(<your_target> PRIVATE DLAF::DLAF)
```

### Documentation

- [Documentation of `master` branch](https://eth-cscs.github.io/DLA-Future/master/)
- [Documentation of `v0.6.0`](https://eth-cscs.github.io/DLA-Future/v0.6.0/)

See [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) for the documentation of older versions, or for the instructions to build it.
