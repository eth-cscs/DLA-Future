# Matrix Distribution

The matrix (also denoted global matrix) is the matrix which is distributed using a 2D block cyclic distribution scheme.
Therefore any of the rank stores in its own memory only a subset of the elements which compose the local matrix.
The matrix is divided in submatrices of the same size (exceptions are the submatrices in the boundaries which can be smaller) called tiles.

## Global to local mapping

The global matrix of size `size` (denoted by blue lines in Fig. 1) is divided in blocks of size `block_size` (red lines).
The blocks are then distributed cyclically among the processes which are mapped in a 2D grid `grid_size`. In Fig. 1 there are 6 processes on a (3x2) grid.

An index is used to indicate the source rank `source_rank_index`, i.e. the rank which has the top left block of the matrix.
For example, Fig. 2 illustrates how the first (4x4) blocks are distributed for different source rank.

Fig. 3 shows the local matrix of size `local_size` (green lines in Fig. 3) of each of the 6 processes.

## Distribution constraints

The following constraints hold:
- Each tile is stored in the memory of a single rank.
- A tile is entirely stored in the memory of a single rank (it cannot be shared/distributed among multiple ranks).
- Each block of the 2D block cyclic distribution is a tile (`tile_size == block_size` for tiles not in the boundaries, `tile_size.rows() <= block_size.rows() && tile_size.cols() <= block_size.cols()` otherwise).
- Each tile is stored using column major layout.

## Naming conventions

Strong type 2D indices and sizes are used to reduce the possibility of index mixing errors.
The following naming convention is used for the types of indices and sizes:
- `GlobalElementIndex`: index of an element in a global matrix.
- `GlobalTileIndex`: index of a tile in a global matrix.
- `LocalTileIndex`: index of a tile in a local matrix.
- `TileElementIndex`: index of in element in a tile.
- `GlobalElementSize`: the size of a global matrix in elements.
- `LocalElementSize`: the size of a local matrix in elements.
- `GlobalTileSize`: the size of a global matrix in tiles.
- `LocalTileSize`: the size of a local matrix in tiles.
- `TileElementSize`: the size of a tile in elements.

Warning: 1D indices and sizes have all the same type (`SizeType`).

## Index manipulation

Utilities exist to transform global indices to local indices and viceversa.
The "Next" versions of conversions from global to local indices return the corresponding local index of the global index if the global index is the given process,
otherwise they return the local index corresponding to the next global index in the given process.

The following table shows how a component of GlobalElementIndex transforms for `block_size = 3`, `grid_size = 3`, `source_rank_index = 1`.

`include/dlaf/matrix/util_distribution.h` contains the functions to transform the indices for any distribution (distribution details are arguments of the functions),
while `include/dlaf/matrix/distribution.h` provides index conversion member functions for the distribution object.

# Local Matrix Layout

The layout of the matrix represents the map which gives the position in the memory of each element of the local matrix.
It is used for compatibility with other libraries and existing applications.
The matrix layout can describe both a column-major matrix or a matrix stored in tile layout.

![Fig. 4. Left: Layout of a column major matrix. Right: Mapping of a tile layout matrix.](figures/layout1.png)
*Fig. 4. Left: Layout of a column major matrix. Right: Mapping of a tile layout matrix.*

![Fig. 5. Left: Layout of a column major matrix. Right: Mapping of a tile layout matrix.](figures/layout2.png)
*Fig. 5. Left: Layout of a column major matrix. Right: Mapping of a tile layout matrix.*

Fig. 4 and 5 show some examples of layouts. The colored and black dots represent each an element of the matrix.
The grey dots are positions in the memory which are never accessed.

The layout is described by 3 parameters which are indicated in Fig 4:
- `tile_leading_dimension`: the distance in the memory of tile element `(i,j)` and `(i,j+1)` (red line),
- `tile_row_offset`: the distance between the first element of the (i,j) tile and the first element of the tile in the next row, i.e. tile (i+1,j) (blue line),
- `tile_col_offset`: the distance between the first element of the (i,j) tile and the first element of the tile in the next column, i.e. tile (i,j+1) (green line),
